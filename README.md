# breakout-game
Tried making a copy of the retro-game called Breakout. Play it at https://ibtehajdoesdevelopment.on.drv.tw/webdev/Games/Breakout/.

In addition, this game requires a keyboard to play, hence the webpage is not responsive to fit mobile screen sizes.

This game was a part of the tutorial course given by Ania Kubow on the Free Code Camp YouTube channel.

Known Bugs:

1. If you catch the ball at either of the 2 corners (the very end, such that the corner of the frame, the platform and the ball are all together), it will still result in a loss of life. I didn't find the time to debug this issue, since it's just a learning project.
